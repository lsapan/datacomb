# datacomb
Decompiled datacomb from http://www.bytemuse.com/post/data-comb-visualization/

I manually decompiled the data-comb.js bundle used on the Demo page http://www.bytemuse.com/dc-demo/.

As such, the code is rather cryptic. The author has said they will be putting the source on GitHub, so this is really just meant to be used in the interim.
